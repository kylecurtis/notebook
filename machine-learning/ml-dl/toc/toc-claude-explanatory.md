## Prompt

> Imagine you are making the most in-depth masterclass on Machine Learning and Deep Learning ever made. This masterclass must contain all the information needed to become a complete master at AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and everything related to it. What would the table of contents for this masterclass look like, where each topic is broken down into as many subtopics as possible?
