## 3 Graphs For Quantitative Data

| Type of Graph | Advantage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dot Plot | Retains individual data |
| Histogram | Displays **shape** |
| Box Plot | Displays **center** and **spread** |

> NOTE: When asked to describe quantitative data, look for (investigate) `shape`, `center`, and `spread`.

## Shape

- **Symmetric**: Left and right side are symmetrical (mountain, etc.).
- **Right Skewed**: Tail end lowers on the right (Left side half-pipe).
- **Left Skewed**: Tail end lowers on the left side (right side half-pipe).
- **Uniform**: All the heights are about the same.

<br>

#### Other Attributes for Shape

- **Outliers**: Unusual data compared with the other data (look for gaps).
- **Modes**: 
	- **Unimodal**: One hump
	- **Bimodal**: Two humps
	- **Multimodal**: Many humps

> NOTE: More than one mode = more than one variable / attribute. Try to separate them to achieve a Unimodal graph.

#### Center Depends On Shape

If shape is symmetric:

- Use **mean** (average):

$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots}{n}$

> NOTE: This value is pulled in the direction of outliers. We let the calculator calculate this!

<br>

If shape is skewed:

- Use **median**.

> NOTE: This value will have half the data values below and and half above it.

<br>

#### Spread Depends On Shape

If shape is symmetric:

- Use Standard Deviation (SD)

$S = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + \cdots} {n - 1}}$

> NOTE: We let the calculator calculate this!

<br> 

If the shape is skewed:

- Use Interquartile Range (IQR)

$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$

> NOTE: The calculator can calculate the 3rd and 1st quarter, and we will take the difference between the two to measure the spread.

## Dot Plot

- Retains Individual
- Label Both Axes
- Scale on Both Axes
- Title
- Shows Shape
- Shows Modes
- Shows Outliers

<br>

## Histogram

- Stores Data in Bins
- Label Both Axes
- Scale on Both Axes
- Title
- Shows Shape
- Shows Modes
- Shows Outliers

<br>

## Box Plot

- Label Axis
- Scale on Axis
- Title
- Shows Center
- Shows Spread

> Any data on the left of the Left Fence (Min), and right of the Right Fence (Max), are outliers (and dotted).

<br>

## Big Picture

- Always graph both (box and histogram) using same scale to get big picture of shape, center and spread.
- Histogram = shape.
- Box Plot = center and spread.
