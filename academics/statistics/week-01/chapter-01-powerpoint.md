## What is Statistics

- Statistics is about **variation**.
- People have different opinions about _issues_ and it can be important to see how their answers vary.
- When we take measurements, we expect individuals to be slightly different.
- So just how much difference is due to random variation (pure chance alone)? And when is a difference so large that we believe something other than random variation is at work?

## 5 W's and How

> Who, What, Why, Where, When, and How

- These give us context to analyze and understand the data collected.

- Many times we are not informed of the Why, Where, When, and How unless we are the researcher.
