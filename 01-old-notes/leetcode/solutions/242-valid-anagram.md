## C++ Code Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if (s.size() != t.size()) {
            return false;
        }

        vector<int> counter(26, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            counter[s[i] - 'a']++;
            counter[t[i] - 'a']--;
        }

        for (int count: counter) {
            if (count != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation

### 1. Class Declaration & Function Signature

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
```

- **Class & Access Modifier:**
    
    - The `Solution` class encapsulates the function, following LeetCode's format.
    - `public:` ensures that the `isAnagram` method is accessible to the testing framework.
- **Function Signature:**
    
    - **Parameters:**
        - `string s`: The first input string.
        - `string t`: The second input string.
    - **Return Type:**  
        The function returns a boolean (`bool`), indicating whether `t` is an anagram of `s`.

### 2. Edge Case: Check String Lengths

```cpp
if (s.size() != t.size()) {
    return false;
}
```

- **Purpose:**  
    This conditional check ensures that both strings have the same length.
    
- **Why This Check is Important:**
    
    - **Anagram Requirement:**  
        Two strings cannot be anagrams if they are of different lengths because anagrams must use exactly the same characters.
    - **Early Exit:**  
        If the lengths differ, the function immediately returns `false`, saving unnecessary computation.

### 3. Initialize the Counter Vector

```cpp
vector<int> counter(26, 0);
```

- **Purpose:**  
    Creates a vector `counter` of size 26 (one slot for each letter of the English alphabet) and initializes all elements to `0`.
    
- **Detailed Reasoning:**
    
    - **Frequency Tracking:**  
        This vector will keep track of the frequency of each character.
    - **Index Mapping:**  
        The expression `s[i] - 'a'` maps each lowercase letter to an index between `0` and `25`.

### 4. Count Character Frequencies

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    counter[s[i] - 'a']++;
    counter[t[i] - 'a']--;
}
```

- **Purpose:**  
    This loop iterates over the characters of both strings simultaneously.
    
- **Detailed Steps:**
    
    - **Increment for String `s`:**
        - `counter[s[i] - 'a']++` increases the count for the character `s[i]`.
    - **Decrement for String `t`:**
        - `counter[t[i] - 'a']--` decreases the count for the character `t[i]`.
- **Combined Effect:**
    
    - **Balanced Counts:**  
        If `t` is an anagram of `s`, each increment from `s` should be canceled out by a corresponding decrement from `t`, leaving all elements in `counter` equal to `0`.

<br>

<br>

### 5. Verify All Counts are Zero

```cpp
for (int count: counter) {
    if (count != 0) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:**  
    Iterates over the `counter` vector to check if every count is zero.
    
- **Detailed Explanation:**
    
    - **Condition Check:**  
        For each element `count` in `counter`, if `count` is not zero, it means that the frequency of at least one character does not match between the two strings.
    - **Early Return:**  
        If any mismatch is found, the function returns `false`, indicating that `t` is not an anagram of `s`.

<br>

---

<br>

### 6. Return True if All Checks Pass

```cpp
return true;
```

- **Purpose:**  
    If the function hasn't returned `false` by this point, all character counts are balanced.
    
- **Conclusion:**  
    Since every character in `s` has a matching count in `t`, the function returns `true`, confirming that `t` is an anagram of `s`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- **Rationale:**
    - The function makes one pass to compare string lengths.
    - It iterates over the strings once (each character is processed exactly one time).
    - Another pass is made over the constant-sized `counter` vector (26 elements).
- **Overall:**  
    The solution runs in linear time relative to the length of the strings.

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- **Rationale:**
    - The `counter` vector has a fixed size of 26, regardless of the input size.
- **Overall:**  
    The space complexity is constant.
