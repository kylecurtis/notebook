## Introduction

Welcome to LeetCode's Interview Crash Course: Cheatsheets.

This is a collection of helpful resources related to interviews and solving LeetCode problems. There are cheatsheets regarding time complexities, data structures & algorithms, the stages of a coding interview, and code templates.

All content here comes from [LeetCode's Interview Crash Course: Data Structures and Algorithm (LICC)](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/), which is LeetCode's official data structures and algorithms course for coding interviews.

If you enjoy the content here and want to learn data structures & algorithms to land software engineering jobs, we highly recommend taking LICC. [Click here](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/703/arraystrings/) to preview a few more articles for free.
